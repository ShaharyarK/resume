        <h2>üìú Summary</h2>

        <p>
          As a highly skilled back-end developer, I have a proven track record of delivering heavy-duty projects using a diverse range of programming languages. With a wealth of experience in server-side programming, I excel in developing Micro-Services architecture, crafting powerful REST APIs, and optimizing back-end development for efficient data concurrency and error handling.
I have deployed numerous services through Terraform, using Cloud Run and Kubernetes Pods for containerized applications and a robust CI/CD pipelining, each equipped with a Pub/Sub mechanism for versatile communication. I have utilized Docker for image builds and BitBucket for repository management and pipelining, allowing me to stay ahead of the curve in the constantly evolving tech landscape.
Working with cutting-edge technologies such as Google ORTools, I have solved real-life map-oriented problems and integrated with Map Box. I have developed APIs with encrypted communication mediums, and have thoroughly unit-tested and integration-tested all services to ensure seamless flow. My background in Data Structures, Object Oriented Programming, and Artificial Intelligence further strengthens my ability to deliver top-quality solutions.
In addition to my technical skills, I have designed and developed a remote-less Hand and Face Recognition drone application that takes photos, performs surveillance, and many more projects, showcasing my innovative and creative thinking.

        </p>

        <p>
          Below are some of the projects I made.

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>
        <h3>FEB 2022 ‚Äì CURRENTLY WORKING ON IT</h3>
        <h4>NEWS ANALYTICS, FINAL YEAR PROJECT</h4>
        <p>
Secured first position in overall batch of 2023 CS/IT for the best Final Year Project.
A multi-platform full stack Dashboard application that takes multiple News Media Broadcasts from YouTube Live, feed them into the script I made, then applies different algorithms on the fetched data such as Person Recognition, and Urdu Text Recognition to create useful insights about the news broadcast, then feeds the data into a database where it can be fetched for later use and all of this is happening in a real-time, the processed frames are then rendered over a Web Application over a Dashboard that I made for this project, the software is finished with all the functionalities implemented.
        </p>
        <h3>FEB 2022</h3>
        <h4>CAMERA BASED ATTENDACE MARKING SYSTEM</h4>
        <p>
The program recognizes the person through Live Camera feed, and marks his attendance with accurate time into a csv file, since this is a personal project, it has not been implemented into a working institution system, however it can be. The program also creates unique signature measurements for each person the machine is fed with and all these unique signatures are saved in a file so that it does not retrain the model every time the program is executed it just loads the saved signatures from the file and with every new user added to the system it creates the signature in the meantime and append it to the signature file. Recognition accuracy is 98%, and the best part about this is that the model is ready to recognize the person with just 1 training picture.
        </p>
        <h3>FEB 2022</h3>
        <h4>YOUTUBE SPAM COMMENTS IDENTIFIER</h4>
        <p>
          The program identifies spam comments on a YouTube video and filters them out and tells you exactly out of how much comments there are spam comments. The implementation is done using NLP for similarity check, and selenium for Web Scraping.
        </p>
        <h3>JAN 2022</h3>
        <h4>AR BASED BOUNCE THE BALL GAME</h4>
        <p>
The game is just like that game where we have to bounce the ball off of a platform we move in the bottom until it's missed and the game is ended, but here it works with our hands without touching the keyboard, the game recognizes your hand and if the ball is over your palm, it bounces and with every bounce you get a score, and the speed of the ball increases gradually until we miss the ball and the game ends.
        </p>
        <h3>JAN 2022 ‚Äì CURRENTLY WORKING ON IT</h3>
        <h4>POINT OF SALE SOFTWARE</h4>
        <p>
          It is a basic Point of Sale software made in C# using .Net Framework, it has a working login system connected with a MySQL database as of now.
        </p>
        <h3>JUNE 2021</h3>
        <h4>SHIFTS BOOKING SYSTEM</h4>
        <p>
It is a an program where it automates certain activities of my previous company's website such as auto-booking shifts for nurses, sending out notifications directly to employees work phones when the new shifts are available on the system to be booked, check availability of booked shifts because some times the shifts would get cancelled by the administrators so we had to keep a check on which shifts were cancelled so that we can book another one for that specific nurse.
        </p>
        <h3>JUNE 2021</h3>
        <h4>NURSE &amp; DOCTOR DETAILS SCRAPER</h4>
        <p>
          I was assigned a task by my former CEO to scrap each nurse's and doctor's details on the website, I made a program where it scraps all these details and save them locally.
          It scrapped about 13 thousand different Nurses and Doctors working in the United Kingdom.
